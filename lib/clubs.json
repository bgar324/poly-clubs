Four headstrong visionaries: Susan Kim, Fannie Pon, Jill Yoshimura, and Reina Yuan, initiated the concept of having an organization that would provide them, as well as other young college women, the opportunity to experience sisterhood and to promote what they felt was integral to the development of successful women. After proposing their ideas to women at the Berkeley campus, they, along with ten strong and willful fellow women, became the founding sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_7\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_7\">Our chapter here at Cal Poly was established in the Spring of 1996 by six strong women dedicated to promoting the values of sisterhood, scholarship, leadership, service, and Asian-American awareness. Now, over twenty years later, our house is stronger than ever and expanding rapidly. While we will always hold dear in our hearts the lasting tradition and strong foundation our sisters before us have established, we are only beginning another phase as the addition of more sisters bring with it many new ideas and insights.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/FgXqGtaazCQ\">https://youtu.be/FgXqGtaazCQ</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">FULL FLEDGED CHAPTERS</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Beta; &mdash; University of California, Davis</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Delta; &mdash; University of California, Santa Cruz</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Zeta; &mdash; Stanford University</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">H &mdash; The University of Texas at Austin</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Theta; &mdash; University of Pennsylvania</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">I &mdash; University of Houston</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">K&nbsp;&mdash; University of California, Irvine</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Lambda; &mdash; University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Nu; &mdash; Pennsylvania State University</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Xi; &mdash; San Jose State University</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\"><strong>&Omicron; &mdash; California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Pi; &mdash; University of Washington</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Rho; &mdash; State University of New York, Buffalo</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Sigma; &mdash; University of Virginia</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Tau; &mdash; Cornell University</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Upsilon; &mdash; University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Chi; &mdash; University of Oklahoma</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Psi; &mdash; Rutgers University</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Alpha;&Alpha; &mdash; University of South Florida</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Alpha;&Beta; &mdash; Duke University</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Alpha;&Gamma; &mdash; State University of New York, Stony Brook</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&Alpha;&Delta; &mdash; University of Florida</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">AE&nbsp;&mdash; University of Wisconsin, Madison</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">AZ &mdash; University of Illinois, Chicago</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">AH&nbsp;&mdash; Baylor University</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">A&Theta;&nbsp;&mdash; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_sqsrte-small\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">Check out our <a href=\"https://www.sloakdphi.com/\"> website</a> to learn more about us!</p>",

With chapters all over the country, Alpha Rho Chi is the largest Social Professional Architecture\r\n fraternity in the United States. Located at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, we welcome students from the College of Architecture and Environmental Design (CAED) to become a part of our family, although all majors are welcome with\r\n an interest in architecture. Over the course of a year we are involved in various activities on and off campus including lectures, workshops, philanthropic events and much more. The largest of our&nbsp;projects is the restoration, cataloging and distribution of\r\n former Cal Poly professor, Vern Swansen's, art collection, which was left to our chapter upon his passing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_font_8 x_x_wixui-rich-text__text\">The many benefits of Alpha Rho Chi include leadership experience (perfect for resumes), advice within the programs of the CAED (thanks to experienced brothers and alumni), and friendships that will last far beyond\r\n graduation.</p>\r\n",

    "Description": "\r\n<p>Attorneys in the Margin is a student-led, pre-law organization dedicated to empowering students from historically marginalized, underrepresented, and underserved communities. We specifically aim to serve students of color, first-generation college students,\r\n low-income students, and those without traditional access to the legal profession, while remaining inclusive to all interested in pursuing a legal career.</p>\r\n<p>Our mission is to bridge the gap between undergraduate education and legal careers by providing practical, hands-on guidance that directly addresses the educational, financial, and professional barriers that many students face when preparing for law school.\r\n Our organization is built around the principle of “Just-Us, For Us, By Us,” reflecting our commitment to justice, identity, access, and community.</p>\r\n<p>Through weekly meetings, we offer a wide range of services and support systems, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Résumé-building and LinkedIn development workshops tailored to legal careers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</li><li>LSAT study groups and affordable or free preparation resource guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</li><li>Personalized support in drafting personal statements and diversity statements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</li><li>Financial literacy workshops focused on budgeting for law school, navigating financial aid processes (FAFSA, LSAC fee waivers), accessing scholarships, and understanding the hidden costs of legal education.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</li><li>Organizational support through planning timelines for applications, LSAT registration, financial deadlines, and scholarship submissions, including templates and strategic resources.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</li><li>Intimate networking and long-term mentorship opportunities with attorneys, judges, JD candidates, LSAT tutors, and Cal Poly alumni currently in the legal field.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Distinct from traditional pre-law associations that primarily serve as informational platforms, Attorneys in the Margin prioritizes action, tangible outcomes, and sustained mentorship. We recognize that informational events often leave marginalized students\r\n with unanswered questions and limited direction; therefore, we emphasize a Learn by Doing approach, equipping students with the structure, skills, and support necessary to take definitive steps toward their legal aspirations.</p>\r\n<p>Our community fosters a culturally affirming, supportive, and action-driven environment where students are encouraged to build their confidence, form meaningful professional relationships, and strengthen their pathways to legal education and careers. Through\r\n social mixers, peer mentorship programs, anonymous feedback polls, and partnerships with campus resources, we ensure that our programming remains responsive to the evolving needs of our members. In taking on the learn by doing motto, we are turning awareness\r\n into an independent action-based community. Ultimately, Attorneys in the Margin is not simply about raising awareness of the legal profession, it is about creating access, offering real guidance, and empowering students to break into a historically exclusive\r\n field with clarity, resilience, and community at their side.</p>\r\n",

The station also acts as a San Luis Obispo County Emergency Communications Center, as it is fully equipped with emergency power and radio equipment to support various public safety agencies in the event of a disaster. The club trains routinely with local agencies in mock-disaster situations and has provided emergency communications during the Highway 41 Fire, the Loma Prieta earthquake, and other disasters both local and statewide. The club also supports other, non-emergency events such as bicycle races, triathlons, and parades. Club radio operators maintain communications both for event logistics and medical emergencies.</p>\r\n<p>-</p>\r\n<p>The club maintains a repeater system to extend the range of handheld radios for club members and other licensed amateur radio operators in the San Luis Obispo area. The club also has a number of ways to connect to our local repeater through internet linking such as through EchoLink or All Star Network. The club is also working on constantly developing new projects with students from different majors in the club so that they can apply the concepts taught in class with the Cal Poly \"Learn By Doing\" philosophy. The club continues to move into the future with expanded Internet connectivity, digital radio projects, and additional wide-area-linked radio systems.</p>\r\n<p>-</p>\r\n<p>Amateur radio is a hobby that attracts a wide range of people interested in all facets of radio communications.

    "Description": "<p>Cal Poly Blockchain aims to teach student and faculty about the applications of blockchain technology and how the career a student or faculty may have chosen has applications to the crypto sector. There are four pillars that make up the organization: Education, Research, Investment, and Development. Education aims to onboard students who may not have experience with crypto but are ambitious to learn. This process is conducted through weekly educational meetings in which there will either be a lecture on blockchain, a guest speaker who works in the crypto industry, or a workshop to teach students how to build on blockchain. Research is the backbone of polyblockchain and is the go-to resource for the other pillars when they are stuck on an issue. The research sector is constantly learning about new developments within blockchain and is even given governance power to vote on proposals to change or manipulate certain blockchains. The investment sector is given the task to build a crypto portfolio that competes with other university blockchain clubs. Members of investment present theses and reasons why the portfolio should be structured the way it is. The development sector is focused on building on the blockchain. They compete in hackathons (often for prize rewards) and receive workshops from established blockchain firms that are willing to provide free tutorials and lessons for how to build on their specific blockchain. Outside of daily duties, every member is encouraged to attend crypto conferences which are sponsored by crypto firms or even other university blockchain clubs.&nbsp;</p>",

Feral cats were trapped as an attempt to decrease the cat population, yet it did not alleviate the problem.<br /><br />The solution to this problem was modeled on the \"Trap, Test, Vaccinate, Medicate, Alter, and Release\" (TTVMAR) technique, developed by the National Feral Cat Resource Center.<br /><br />A second senior project resulted in an adoption program where students domesticated feral cats and found good homes for them.<br /><br />Our adoption program has placed more than 3,000 cats and kittens into caring homes. We continue to work with other agencies to reach a time when there are no more homeless cats.</p>",

In addition to our involvement in campus, our sisters participate in numerous philanthropic efforts. We are involved in campus wide sponsored service events as well as other Greek community&rsquo;s philanthropy events.

    "Description": "<p><strong>Welcome to Cal Poly SLO Club Tennis!</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We are a co-ed, club tennis organization. Founded in 2009, our team is known for being the perfect blend of competition and fun. Each year, our competitive team travels throughout California as well as across the United States to compete in 12+ large-scale tournaments against club tennis teams throughout the country. As a close-knit team, we are one big tennis family. Some of our best results include placing 1st at 2022 and 2023 Regionals, 2nd at 2024 Regionals, 10th at 2024 Nationals, 2nd at 2023 Nationals, 6th at 2022 Nationals, and consistently being one of the top teams in the country year after year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Club tennis is comprised of a competitive team and a general team. To join the competitive team, you must attend a 2-day tryout process. At tryouts, a $10 tryout fee is required. The first day of tryouts consists of common hitting drills and basic shot practice, while the second day consists of competitive match play. If you cannot make the tryout dates, we will also have alternate tryouts held at a different time after tryouts. Outside of tryouts, alternate tryouts, and extenuating circumstances, there will be no other opportunities to join the competitive team. Players on the competitive team will pay $225 in dues for the year up-front or $90 per quarter.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Competitive team tryouts</strong> will be held on <strong>October 4 and 5, 2025&nbsp;</strong>at the Cal Poly Tennis Courts. On both days, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">men will tryout from 9-11AM</span>&nbsp;and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> women will tryout from 12-2PM</span>.

Alternate tryout dates will only be considered in exceptional circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>General team is no-cut and is welcoming to players of all skill levels. There will be multiple events and team bonding activities held throughout the year. Players interested in joining the general team can do so at any point in the year as there is no try-out process.

The criteria for evaluation are INNOVATION, AESTHETICS, FUNCTIONALITY, DURABILITY, and ECOLOGICAL COMPATIBILITY. &nbsp;To ensure a team's&nbsp;structure adheres to Design Village's&nbsp;Official&nbsp;Competition Rules, contestants must occupy their structures for the duration of the competition weekend.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
    "Summary": "Design Village is a student-run organization that hosts annual design-build competitions under the direct sponsorship of Cal Poly's CAED. Competitors across the country compete alongside Cal Poly students to claim winner of the year's theme. ",

The program was originally designed to engage men and the culture of masculinity on campus toward the goal of ending sexual assault through efforts focused on gender-based violence prevention. Over the years the program has evolved to increase its support of marginalized masculine identities and has expanded opportunities for all students to engage in conversations about masculinity, the socialization of gender norms, and gender identity development. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Where it is located: <strong>UU 209 (new location as of Winter 2023) </strong> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When is the center open: <strong>9-5pm </strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What can I do in the center: &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>computer, community space, dialogues, health resources, queer resources, education, basic needs </strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Insert about center events &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Movember </strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Movember is M&amp;M&rsquo;s annual men&rsquo;s health awareness month, featuring a series of events, dialogues, workshops, etc. highlighting a specific theme related to men&rsquo;s health.

Through student-led cultural presentations and workshops/presentations conducted by guest speakers, we cover a wide range of cultural topics such as life for Japanese Americans in the concentration camps, Japanese Americans in politics, Japanese holidays, traditions, and food, defining the term \"Nikkei\", and more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Service</strong></p>\r\n<p>We believe in not just learning about our culture and community, but also finding ways to give back, so another component of our club is doing service projects to serve the local Japanese American community or the greater AAPI community. Our club is also very hands-on, as we believe that the best way to get members to care about our club's mission is by having them actively serve in some capacity. Staff and leadership opportunities are readily available for members to step into, which not only increases the engagement of our members but also allows our club to sustain itself in future years.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Social</strong></p>\r\n<p>At the end of the day, we are a social club too, and we pride ourselves on finding the perfect balance between learning about our culture and having fun. We have fams to help our members get to know a smaller group of people on a deeper level, we have socials with other NSUs, and our general meetings often consist of games, competitions. Our bigger in-person events include potlucks, picnics, basketball tournaments with other NSUs and intramurals, family competitions, beach days, and more.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Basic Info</strong></p>\r\n<p>General Meetings: Tuesdays, 7:00-8:00 pm</p>",

We advocate for the radical but essential notion that people living in poverty deserve preferential access to high-quality health care.</p>\r\n<p data-end=\"1130\" data-start=\"706\"><strong data-end=\"743\" data-start=\"706\">Community Building and Education:</strong>&nbsp;Understanding the systemic inequities that drive poor health outcomes in impoverished countries is central to our work. Through curricula, webinars, discussions, and events, we raise awareness about the social and economic forces that undermine global health equity. By connecting poverty and health outcomes, we aim to cultivate an informed and engaged community dedicated to change.</p>\r\n<p data-end=\"1430\" data-start=\"1132\"><strong data-end=\"1148\" data-start=\"1132\">Fundraising:</strong>&nbsp;We organize events and campaigns to provide PIH with resources to prevent unnecessary deaths and deliver care in some of the world&rsquo;s poorest places. Beyond raising funds, we challenge traditional ideas of wealth and health care access, promoting a more just and equitable vision.</p>\r\n<p data-end=\"1687\" data-start=\"1432\">Each year, we focus our collective efforts on advancing the right to health. By advocating for justice, fundraising in solidarity with partner communities, and educating ourselves and others, we contribute to meaningful progress in global health equity.</p>",

Puppy sitters help the raisers by sitting pups when the raiser is unable, to support the raisers and give them breaks, and to help socialize the pup through working with new people and experiencing new routines. Sits can last anywhere from an hour to a few days, depending on the needs of the raiser and the availability of sitters. General club members attend weekly meetings along with the raisers and sitters and get hands-on practice handling, training, and socializing the pups during meetings. We also organize occasional club outings on the weekends for additional socialization and hand-on handling and training in new locations. Previous club outings have been trips to downtown SLO, Morro Bay, and Cal Poly baseball games. Poly Pups is a fun and impactful club with incredible members and adorable puppies!</p>",

Along with being a social club for Puentistas, we also host several campus tours for Puentistas who are thinking about applying to cal poly.

Their objective was to</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;form a national organization of professional engineers to serve as role models in the Hispanic</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;community. The concept of Networking was the key basis for the organization. SHPE quickly</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;established two student chapters to begin the network that would grow to encompass the nation</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;as well as reach countries outside the United States. Today, SHPE enjoys a strong but</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;independent network of professional and student chapters throughout the nation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1>&nbsp;Cal Poly&rsquo;s SHPE History</h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers Student Chapter of California Polytechnic State</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;University, San Luis Obispo was established in 1978 as part of a commitment to the recruitment</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;and retention of Hispanic engineering and science students.

Members of Sigma Omega Nu hope to obtain the support of all women by being positive role models. Members strive on creating supportive and lasting relationships with each other.

For many years, Epsilon Delta has demonstrated its excellence by\r\n leading the Cal Poly Greek community in grade-point-average, athletic participation, and community involvement.

So, our purpose lies in the goal to investigate different forms of media and the meanings behind them. Many movies, TV shows, video games, books, and more all have complex storylines that require context and discussions to truly understand. Our purpose is to bring hidden details and theories to light in an effort to piece together a cohesive narrative. Mystery and vagueness are our favorite contributors to the lore of a story. We hope to also encourage students to think critically on the more hidden meanings of things outside of this club as well, encouraging an open mind on all fronts of life. In our club, there will be no correct answer. All interpretations of the meanings and storylines behind different stories will be encouraged and accepted.</span></p>",
